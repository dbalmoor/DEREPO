A heart attack occurs when blood flow to a part of the heart is blocked, usually by a blood clot. Without oxygenated blood, the heart muscle begins to die. A stroke is a brain attack, cutting off vital blood flow and oxygen to the brain. Stroke happens when a blood vessel feeding the brain gets clogged or bursts.

Stroke is the third leading cause of death in the United States. Treatment is most effective when given within the first few hours after a stroke has occurred, so itâ€™s important to recognize the symptoms and act quickly.
